This is a list of the 50 most frequently used nouns in written English.
Learning to use these nouns is a good starting place for any beginner English learner who wants to build up his English vocabulary.
Nouns give you a concrete way to talk about the people, places, and things around you.
However, too many English learners focus on memorizing long lists of nouns in the beginning.
It's easy to get carried away, learning the names of all the animals at the zoo, 
all the tools in your toolbox, or all the types of clothing in your closet.
While you may eventually learn all those nouns, mastering a shorter, more targeted list is a better use of your time.
You can always look up more precise nouns as you need them.</p>
